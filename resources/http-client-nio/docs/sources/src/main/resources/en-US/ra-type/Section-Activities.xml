	<para>The single activity object for &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor is the <literal>org.restcomm.slee.ra. httpclient.nio.ratype. HttpClientNIORequestActivity</literal> interface. Each activity is mapped to a single HTTP request, and through its interface a SBB may cancel the request, or check the request status. The asynchronous event related to the server response is fired in the activity.</para>
	
	<para>An activity starts when a SBB, executes a request, through the RA SBB Interface, and it ends when the response event is unreferenced.</para>
