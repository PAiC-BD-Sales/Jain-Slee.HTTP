## Introduction JAIN SLEE Resource Adaptor
The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant protocol used on the Internet today. Web services, network-enabled appliances, and the growth of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP protocol beyond user-driven web browsers while increasing the number of applications that require HTTP support; for example, Applications developed using SLEE. The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component provides an efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client-side of the most recent HTTP standards and recommendations. HTTP Client RA provides the client-side HTTP standard within the SLEE environment, using the popular Apache Commons HTTP Client library. An SBB can use the HTTP Client RA to make a request and get the Response Synchronously or Asynchronously.
